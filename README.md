### About the Experiment 

Ionic conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct electric current. The conductivity (σ), is expressed as the inverse of resistivity (ρ) i.e., σ = 1/ρ and its unit is Siemens. Specific conductivity is the reciprocal of the specific resistance of a solution measured between two electrodes 1 cm2 in area and 1 cm apart. Conductivity is measured by placing two electrodes (with opposite electrical charge) in the electrolyte. For a known electrical current, the voltage drop across the electrodes reveals the electrolyte's resistance
