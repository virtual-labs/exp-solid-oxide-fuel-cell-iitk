1) sample is fixed in between the electrodes of sample holder and is placed in furnace.<br>
2) Thermocouple wires of sample holder are connected to furnace temperature controller and furnace temperature is programmed as per requirement.<br>
3) Electrode wires of sample holder are connected to LCR meter.<br>
4) LCR meter generates impedance(z) - phase angle(theta) data for frequencies varying from 20 to 2 MHz using Lab view software.<br>
5) Plot of z' (Zcos(theta) i.e.resisatance ) Vs z" ((-)Zsin(theta) i.e. capacitance ), named as 'Nyquist plot', is drawn.<br>
6) bulk, grain and electrode impedance behavior are figured out from this Nyquist plot.
